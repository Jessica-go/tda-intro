# Topological Data Analysis (TDA) in Python – Intro Projects

This repository contains two beginner-friendly notebooks designed to introduce the core ideas of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) using Python.
The focus is on understanding persistent homology, persistence diagrams, and the effect of noise on topological structure.

## Notebooks

1. 01_persistent_homology_circle.ipynb  
2. 02_noise_vs_structure.ipynb  

The notebooks will live in the `notebooks/` folder.

## Requirements

Main libraries:
- ripser
- persim
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy

Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
